 # popularMoviesApp

Project 1 from Android Developer Nanodegree course.

In this project, we build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.

The info is loaded from "The Movie database" (https://www.themoviedb.org/)

 When test this code, please change the constant API_KEY (/app/src/main/java/mx/saudade/popularmoviesapp/models/Manager.java), with your own Api Key.

If you don´t already have an account, you will need to create one (https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup), in order to request an API Key.
